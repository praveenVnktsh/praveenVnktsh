### Hello there!

I'm a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Insititute. Did my undergraduation at IIT Gandhinagar in Electrical Engineering, and am passionate about building robotic systems that can make an impact on society.

Currently exploring advanced perception for robots. I believe that the following will be huge in the future:
- Human robot natural interactions
- Multimodal robot sensing (speech (raw audio) + vision + touch).

I am always up for playing a sport, and love adventure. Reach me on LinkedIn here.
